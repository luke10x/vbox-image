# Create VirtualBox disk image with preinstalled Debian

This installation runs debootstrap on a VirtualBox disk image.
It consists of four scripts:

 - *create-vbox.sh* creates a VM with an empty disk image;
 - *mount-vbox.sh* mounts the disk image, also installs GRUB to it;
 - *install-debian.sh* installs Debian to the mounted image;
 - *umount-vbox.sh* does some cleanup.
